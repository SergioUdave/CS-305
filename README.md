SNHU CS305 Software Security

# Description
This project helped my understanding of not only being able to write functional code, but being able to write secure functional code. In this scenario, it was important for Artemis Financial to make sure that information was being encrypted properly with updated methods, such as incorporating an SHA-256 algorithm cipher to encrypt data. There was also static testing that was performed in order to check vulnerabilities within the dependencies of the code. I often referenced the recommended reading material "Iron-Clad Java: Building Secure Web Applications" to learn about the different types of attack vectors, and ways to mitigate potential attacks.

During the process of refactoring the code, it is important to make sure that there is proper error-handling and testing done to ensure that no new vulnerabilities were introduced. Static testing is performed again and any new dependencies added are checked to see if any new vulnerabilities are added. It is important to make sure that dependencies are always updated regularly in case new fixes to bugs are found that may make your application more secure.
